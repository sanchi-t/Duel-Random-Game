# Duel-Random-Game


A fun 2 player interactive web game where both the players compete against each other. <br /><br />
Each player gets to roll a dice with two option to either roll again or to hold.
Holding immediately changes the turn to the other player but the score is added to the total score. <br /><br />
If a player rolls a 1 the score will be changed to zero and the turn will be changed
and nothing will be added to the total score.
The first person to have a score equal or more than of 50 will be awarded as winner. <br /> <br />
A dedicated new game button has been provided so that the user can play it multiple times without <br />
having to go through the trouble of refreshing the page.
